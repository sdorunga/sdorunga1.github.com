Jekyll is a very powerful and very convenient blogging engine with a great feature set and most importantly for me, does not use a database so you can just put the entire thing under source control and push when needed.
Since this site is currently running on the Jekyll blog engine I figured it would be most appropriate to have a guide on starting up from scratch. I chose JekyllBootstrap to do this as it's by far the easiest way to get going with the engine.
